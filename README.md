# Unplanned-Failure-of-Wind-Turbine
CRISP-ML(Q) (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Machine learning with Quality Assurance) project management methodology steps implemented in this project

Business Problem: Unplanned failure of Wind turbine engine is leading to huge losses and electricity generation is negatively impacted.

Business Objective: Minimize unplanned failure
Business constraint: Maximize Power Generation

Success criteria: 
Business success criteria: reduce the unplanned failure of wind turbine by atleast 30%
Machine Learning success criteria: Achieve a accuracy of min 85% or above.
Economic Success criteria: Achieve a cost saving of atleast $1.2M per year due to reduction of unplanned downtime
